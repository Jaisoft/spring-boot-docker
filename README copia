- Docker concepts

Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to build, run, and share applications 
with containers. 

Containerization are:

    Flexible: 
    Lightweight: 
    Portable: 
    Loosely Couple:
    Scalable: 
    Secure: 


- Image

An image includes everything needed to run an application - the code or binary, runtimes, 
dependencies, and any other filesystem objects required.

- Container

Running process, with encapsulation features applied to it in order to keep it isolated from 
the host and from other containers. That each container interacts with its own private filesystem; 
this filesystem is provided by a Docker image. 

- Test Docker version

        $ docker --version

- List all images

        $ docker images

- List containers

        $ docker ps

- Delete all images

        $ docker rmi $(docker images -q)

- Stop all containers

        $ docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)

- Delete all containers

        $ docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

- Build image with Dockerfile on the project directory

        $ docker build -t docker-docs-image .

- Docker run
